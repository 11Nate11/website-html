# HTML website

Now that you know how HTML works it is time to put it to use and create your first website. When you are done you will have created the home page for all of the work that you do in this class. When you are done this page can serve as a portfolio of the abilities you have mastered. To get started take the following steps.

1. Clone this repository to your development environment.
1. The repository contains two files, `index.html` and `deploy.sh`. `index.html` contains an example HTML document. `deploy.sh` contains a console shell script for copying `index.html` up to your production server and overwritting the default Caddy server home page. Open up and review these files.
1. Modify `index.html` to personalize it to yourself. Don't worry about making it look pretty at this point. You are only trying to get the content and structure right. You can come back latter and style it with CSS and make it interactive with JavaScript.
  1. Give a brief profile description.
  1. Include links to the CodePens for your assignments.
  1. Replace the profile image with an image of yourself. Make sure the image is small (<100k) so that you don't eat up your server's harddrive space.
1. Run the `deploy.sh` script from your console window to push your changes to your deployment site.
1. Open a browser window and verify that your new home page is showing up for your domain.
